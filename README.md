## Howdy ⊂(◉‿◉)つ

I'm just a bro adventuring through the programming space, building web apps, and sharing discoveries along the way.

Oh, and I also love listening to some synthwave bangers while working! My current favorite is: [Forgotten Faces by
Baldocaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fVnzvtR3us) 💿

Currently, I’m deeply focused on creating awesome software and improving developer relations at [Qest](https://qest.cz/en) & [Heureka Group](https://heureka.group/cz-en/)

Until next time, have a great day! 💖
